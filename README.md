## Testing

Please see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for all testing completed.

## Deployment

### Heroku
To deploy to Heroku, follow these steps:

1. In the `scripts` section of `package.json` in gitpod, added the following command:
```
"heroku-prebuild": "npm install -g serve",
```
2. Add Procfile to project root & populate with the following:
```
web: serve -s build
```
3. Log in to heroku.com and open the dashboard for your react application (remember this is separate from the DRF application that runs your API).
4. Select 'Create new app' from the 'New' menu at the top right.
5. Select the “Deploy” tab in the dashboard.
6. Scroll down to the bottom and then select “Deploy Branch”.
7. Wait for your build to complete (you can click “view build log” to watch the process in a larger window).
8. When you see the message “deployed to Heroku” in the build log, click the “open app” button at the top of the page.


### Connecting to the API:
1. Login to the Heroku app of the project DRF-API, and under the Settings tab, added the following Config Vars.
- Key: CLIENT_ORIGIN | Value: https://react-app-name.herokuapp.com
- Key: CLIENT_ORIGIN_DEV | Value: https://gitpod-browser-link.442-fg.gitpod.io
2. Check that the trailing slash `\` at the end of both links has been removed, and save the Config Vars.
3. Install the Axios package, & create supporting `axiosDefaults.js` as shown in Moments Walkthrough



## API error and feedback
Here are the examples that are absolutely fine: three 401s on mount when not logged in, 401 error when going to sign up/ sign in page, which happens when we check if we need to redirect a logged in user away from these pages.
A 401 error when providing incorrect form input such as submitting the sign
in form without entering a username. And 401 error when an access token has expired,
it is refreshed in the background and the request eventually succeeds.

## Issues

- After my adventures was created and there was a number of images uploaded under user A. I logged in under user B and I was able to see the images that user A had uploaded. This was solved by adding Authenticated only and adding a filter to the queryset, in the backend api.
- When the dropdown menu was added and tested on a small screen (mobile). The dropdown menu was opening but wouldn't open. This was fixed by removing ref and changing a const for easy to read function.
